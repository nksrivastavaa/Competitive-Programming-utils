Everything I need to code quickly!

### Note
For faster code execution, you can precompile `bits/stdc++.h`
1) Just look for the "bits" folder in your mingw folder. (It is generally something like : `C:\msys64\mingw64\include\c++\12.1.0\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bits`)
2) You will find the `stdc++.h` file there.
3) Open CMD in that location and compile the header file by the command: `g++ stdc++.h`
4) Congrats! You have now successfully precompiled `bits/stdc++.h`. To confirm this, a new file named `stdc++.h.gch` should appear in the bits folder.
